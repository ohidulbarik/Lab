A* solves the 8-Puzzle problem
Implementation of N-Puzzle in Python. I have used two classes in my code: Node & Puzzle.
Node class defines the structure of the state(configuration) and also provides functions to move
the empty space and generate child states from the current state. Puzzle class accepts the
initial and goal states of the N-Puzzle problem and provides functions to calculate the f-score of
any given node(state).

Evaluating New Marketing Campaigns Using Bayesian Inference
Assume that we run an ecommerce platform for clothing and in order to bring people to our
site, we deploy several digital marketing campaigns. These campaigns feature various ad
images and captions, and are presented on a number of social networking websites. We want
to present the ads that are the most successful. For the sake of simplicity, we can assume that
the most successful campaign is the one that results in the highest click-through rate: the ads
that are most likely to be clicked if shown.
